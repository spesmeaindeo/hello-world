### I am a mom of 3 born and raised on Vancouver Island. While completeing school, I am also working full time and helping my spouse with his technology and electronic repairs business. 

## My goals are to be a continous learner and to be able to gain skills to be able to take a **bigger** step into the family business with **a_goal_of_leaving_something_for_our_kids_to_carry on_with_that_we_are_all_passionate_about** and can use to further all of our creativity.
