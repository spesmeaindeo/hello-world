The benefits of using PHP code analysis, automated testing, code style enforcement, performance analysis and security vulnerability.

It touches base on which are best to use for assistance in code quality and why.

Some of the ket reasons of why quality code tools can be important is for assistance in error detection, security vulnerability, performance optimization, adhering to the standards of coding, and keeping up with the continuos improvement of developers to gain insights, patterns and techniques to deliver reliable and efficient applications.

## Self-Evaluation of work

3- Spent significant time reading and tryiog to find all the key points surrounding what makes quality code. While one article doesn't dive fully into the quality checklist, it covers how proper codes should start and be used for quality rendering with a large array of key examples. This will help in consistency and efficiency as well as familiarity. These I feel are noteable key points surrounding PHP quality starter code. It helps with all developers understanding the standards.
